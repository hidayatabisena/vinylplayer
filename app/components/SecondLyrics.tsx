      <p>
      If a man could be two places at once,<br />
      I&apos;d be with you,<br />
      Tomorrow and today,<br />
      Beside you all the way.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
      If the world should stop revolving,<br />
      Spinning slowly down to die,<br />
      I&apos;d spend the end with you,<br />
      And when the world was through, <br />
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
      Then one by one the stars would go out,<br />
      And you and I would simply fly away.
      </p>
